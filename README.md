A Java-based Number Guessing Game where players guess a random number between 1 and 100. Players can quit anytime by entering -1, and the correct number is revealed. After each round, they can choose to play again. This project demonstrates fundamental Java concepts like loops, conditionals, random number generation, and user input handling.
